# TDCN
Created by Mingchun Li & Dali Chen

### Introduction:

We propose an effective boundary detection network named TDCN based on transformer. 
Different with the pure transformer, it involves difference convolution when acquiring token 
embedding. The difference convolution including TAG layer explicitly extracts the gradient 
information closely related to boundary detection. 
Then these features are further transformed together with the dataset token through our 
transformer. Our boundary-aware attention in transformer and TAG layer achieve efficient 
feature extraction to keep the model lightweight. 
And the dataset token embedding gives our 
model the ability to universal predictions for multiple datasets. 
Finally, we use the bidirectional boosting strategy to train the head functions for 
multi-scale features. These strategies and designs ensure good performances of the model. 
And multiple experiments in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 

### Prerequisites
